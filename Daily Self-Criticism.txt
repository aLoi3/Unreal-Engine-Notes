Today I have met my team again after summer break. After summer I feel much more confident in my skills to talk with others and develop new and old ideas. 
We've been talking about what game ideas we want to prototype and what can go wrong and what can go right. Had PO meeting as well where we talked about 
whether some ideas could be realised and sold in the future and Michael suggested a few ideas - the University can fund some development as we are going 
to sell the game.

From programmers' perspective I'm not very familiar with Unreal's c++ coding (we are going for Unreal Engine for this year), so I decided to start off with looking 
up some tutorials for certain things that could be helpful in the future - some of them being some of the features we want in a game. Today I wasn't feeling like 
starting actually prototyping/coding, that's why I decided to first find tutorials, read them and, eventually, start coding them (depending whether we decide that 
that could be useful to make in the first place). I've found networking for Unreal - making multiplayer viable - which is one of the key features for one of our ideas. 
Also, I found how to (potentailly) make multithreading for Unreal Engine 4, which could later fix some lag issues, I hope.

Zac has also showed me how to clone a repo without it being laggy and crushing (using depth 1 - in which case it will only download the necessary files) as well as 
showing useful stuff such as "unittest", which is used in many proffesional cases where the code is being tested while refactoring, which makes it easier to 
debug/refactor. We've talked about some of the issues that could occur when we prototype/start making a game, but hopefully that won't be much of a problem 
and we could handle it.

During this first day of Uni, I've been feeling pretty confident, ready to start working, but also a bit scared of the workflow we are going to have and whether 
I could be able to handle everything on time. There's surely going to be problems, unfinished work, too much confidence in my skills and work will take longer 
that I would expect it to take. Also, don't forget my lazyness... But I'm feeling much better than I did previous two years, I had refreshing summer break and 
I found someone that has changed me a bit, that will be changing me for the best and who will, hopefully, cheer me up during tough times.
